# Juicy Files Finder (Linux)

This project provides a shell script (`script.sh`) to help you find juicy files on Linux systems. Juicy files are those that may contain sensitive information, credentials, or configuration details useful for security assessments or troubleshooting.

## Features
- Searches for files with names or extensions commonly associated with sensitive data (e.g., passwords, configs, keys).
- Fast and easy to use on any Linux system.

## Usage
Run the script with:

```sh
zsh script.sh
```

Or make it executable and run:

```sh
chmod +x script.sh
./script.sh
```

## Project Structure
- `script.sh`: Main script to find juicy files
- `README.md`: Documentation
- `.gitignore`: Ignores editor and environment files

## Disclaimer
Use responsibly and only on systems you have permission to scan.
